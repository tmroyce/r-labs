# r-labs

## Learning lab

a space where I explore R, one step at a time.

Working through data science concepts and building up my R skills across:
fundamentals → workflow → wrangling → visualization → statistics → modeling → projects

Contains my notes, code examples, and practice exercises as I learn.
